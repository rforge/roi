\title{Write Optimization Problem}
\description{Write a optimization problem to a file.}
\usage{
write.op(x, file, type=c("lp", "mps", "freemps"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of type \code{OP}.}
\item{file}{a character giving the name of the file the optimization problem
            is written to.}
\item{type}{a character giving the name of the file format used to store the 
      optimization problem.}
}
\details{
  The optimization problems can be written to the three file formats \code{"lp"},
  \code{"mps"} and \code{"freemps"}.
  Where it seems important to note that the \code{"lp"} format refers to
  \code{lpsolves} (\url{http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/lp-format.htm}) 
  native file format and not to the \code{CPLEX LP format}.
