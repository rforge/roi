\title{Quadratic Objective Function}
\usage{
Q_objective(Q, L = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q}{a \eqn{n \times n} matrix with numeric entries representing the quadratic
part of objective function. Sparse matrices of class
\code{"simple_triplet_matrix"} can be supplied.}

\item{L}{a numeric vector of length \eqn{n}, where \eqn{n} is the
number of objective variables.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{"Q_objective"} which inherits
from \code{"objective"}.
}
\description{
A quadratic objective function is typically of the form
\eqn{x^\top Qx + c^\top x} where \eqn{Q} is a (sparse) matrix
defining the quadratic part of the function and \eqn{c} is a
(sparse) vector of coefficients to the \eqn{n} defining the linear
part.
